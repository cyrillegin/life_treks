                        The is a demonstration of <a href="https://d3js.org/">D3.js</a>. D3 is graphing library for javascript.
                        I've used D3 on many projects primarily for data visualization of sensors polled. <span class="strike">In the above example,
                        What you're seeing is the last days' readings from my fish tank, beer fermentation fridge, and a couple
                        other temperature sensors. I'm using another software I created,
                        <a href="https://github.com/cyrillegin/dragonfly">Dragonfly</a>
                        to collect and store the readings and then everyday I ship the results online.</span>
                        The readings being viewed currently are randomly generated until I can get the mongo integration working between this site and my local smarthome network.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        D3 is ment to be interactive, allowing for a more immersive expirence with the data you collect. So here's a list of some things
                        you can do with this graph.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Zoom in - click and drag on the graph.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Zoom out - click the zoom out button.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Focus graph - click on the graph line to auto format to that line.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Input controls - Select the input button to bring up the custom controls panel.

                        <a href="https://threejs.org/">Threejs</a> is a javascript library for webgl. It allows the creation and manipulation of 3D objects in the browser.

                        This is a demonstration showing a cutout of my apartment. The green arcs you see connections between different raspberry pis
                        Hovering over them will display a list of the sensor readings being sent and their last readings.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You can click and drag to rotate your view. right click and it will pan your view. Scroll or pinch to zoom in and out.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Note: As you can see, this is very much under development. The one downside to using threejs or any kind of 3D library is
                        the enromus amount of time needed to create something elegant. Once other parts of the site have been finished, I'll will return to this portion.
                        Also you'll notice that readings arn't actaully being displayed. That's because I haven't released a public api to my Dragonfly project.
