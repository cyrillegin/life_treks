                        The is a demonstration of <a href="https://d3js.org/">D3.js</a>. D3 is graphing library for javascript.
                        I've used D3 on many projects primarily for data visualization of sensors polled. <span class="strike">In the above example,
                        What you're seeing is the last days' readings from my fish tank, beer fermentation fridge, and a couple
                        other temperature sensors. I'm using another software I created,
                        <a href="https://github.com/cyrillegin/dragonfly">Dragonfly</a>
                        to collect and store the readings and then everyday I ship the results online.</span>
                        The readings being viewed currently are randomly generated until I can get the mongo integration working between this site and my local smarthome network.

                        D3 is ment to be interactive, allowing for a more immersive expirence with the data you collect. So here's a list of some things
                        you can do with this graph.
