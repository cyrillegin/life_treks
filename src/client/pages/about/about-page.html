                        I'm a software engineer, inventor, beer brewer, and avid outdoorsman. I work for a start-up as their lead front-end engineer.
                        I like playing with IoT systems and creating home automation systems. I'm also in the final stretch of a computer science degree,
                        I already have an animation/visual effects bachelors.

                        It all started when I got my goldfish... I wanted to make sure their temperature was perfect. I got myself an Arduino, hooked up a
                        temperature sensor, and watched the readings come it. Years of development later, I now run a custom dashboard giving me real time
                        updates from the temperature out on my balcony, the moisture of the soil for Earl (he's a <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=begonia&safe=off&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS707US707&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi7p8a_78bYAhWJ6oMKHbp2A6YQ_AUICigB&biw=1556&bih=953">begonia</a>) to if there's any motion in my living room when there shouldn't be.

                        Lately my interests have been in home efficiency and automation. One of my latest projects has been creating a temperature
                        regulated fermentation fridge. Next up will be creating an auto-waterer for Earl. The goal of all these little projects is to start
                        creating a repository for these simple easy to do projects that anyone at any experience level can setup.
