    This was a project done for my senior project at New Mexico State University. The goal was to be able to construct a boat in 3D and output the blueprints so that an amateur boat maker could build it. The user would also be able to save and load their projects via json files as well as be able to export in obj or stl formats for 3D printing.
    <br />
    This demo allows you to view the demo boat and trigger some different rendering methods. You can also pan, zoom, and orbit around the boat.
